# KV Cache Algorithm Backlog

Evidence date: 2026-06-23.

This backlog tracks representative KV cache algorithms to keep or implement in KVCache-Factory and its nano-vllm / mini-sglang ports. GitHub star counts were checked with the GitHub API; citation counts are approximate and were checked with OpenAlex or Semantic Scholar when available.

## Selection Rules

- Prefer methods with high citations, high GitHub stars, or broad baseline usage.
- Prefer mechanism diversity over near-duplicate implementations.
- Implement first in KVCache-Factory, then port the same algorithm contract to the runtime forks.
- Record whether a method is already implemented, partially implemented, or missing.

| Priority | Category | Method | Evidence | Implementation target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Runtime Porting Notes

- KVCache-Factory can use Hugging Face monkeypatches; nano-vllm and mini-sglang need runtime-native integration.
- Nano-vllm status: `nanovllm.kvcache_factory` now contains CPU-tested core selectors for StreamingLLM/H2O/SnapKV/Quest/NACL/Scissorhands, MiniCache cross-layer merge/restore utilities, nearest-token merge for LOOK-M/KVMerger-style modes, KIVI/KVQuant/GEAR config metadata (with `compress_kv_gear`/`decompress_kv_gear`), and decode-time block-table policies for StreamingLLM, Quest, NACL, Scissorhands, and H2O (`build_decode_h2o_block_table`) plus a runtime-side `MiniCachePairStore` for adjacent-layer compressed-pair storage with shared K-determined retention.
- Mini-sglang status: `minisgl.kvcache_factory` now contains the matching CPU-tested core selectors for StreamingLLM/H2O/SnapKV/Quest/NACL/Scissorhands, MiniCache cross-layer merge/restore utilities, nearest-token merge, KIVI/KVQuant/GEAR config metadata (with `compress_kv_gear`/`decompress_kv_gear`), and decode-time policies for StreamingLLM, Quest, NACL, Scissorhands, and H2O (`build_decode_h2o_page_table` / `build_decode_h2o_indices`) for FA/FI/TRTLLM backends, plus a runtime-side `MiniCachePairStore` mirroring the nano-vllm contract.
- For nano-vllm, preserve block-table and cache allocation invariants before pruning or merging tokens.
- For mini-sglang, preserve prefix-sharing/radix-cache semantics before modifying cache contents.
- StreamingLLM runtime caveat: nano-vllm retention is rounded to full KV blocks because its default paged cache uses 256-token blocks; mini-sglang is token-exact when `page_size=1`.
- Quest runtime caveat: both runtime forks reduce per-head Quest page scores to one sequence-level block/page table because their paged-attention kernels accept one table per request. Nano-vllm is block-rounded; mini-sglang is token-exact with `page_size=1`.
- NACL runtime caveat: paper-NACL is encoding-time. The runtime forks expose decode-time NACL policies that use the current query as the proxy and Quest-style page-min/max metadata as the score, then apply NACL's protected-sink/recent + top-K + random selection at the page level. Nano-vllm is block-rounded; mini-sglang is token-exact with `page_size=1`. Deterministic random sampling requires the caller to pass a `torch.Generator` with a fixed seed.
- Scissorhands runtime caveat: the paper accumulates per-token persistence-of-importance across decode steps. Runtime callers may pass an `importance` buffer (`[total_pages]` or `[kv_heads, total_pages]` per sequence) which is reduced across heads and used directly. If none is supplied the policy falls back to a single-step Quest-style query-vs-page-extreme score so the API is usable standalone. `selection="prob"` samples by softmax-of-importance with optional `random_temperature` and a `torch.Generator` for determinism.
- MiniCache runtime caveat: the paper folds adjacent layers' KV via SLERP direction sharing with per-layer magnitudes and high-angular-distance retention. The runtime `MiniCachePairStore` stores compressed pairs keyed by `(current_layer_idx, previous_layer_idx)`. K's angular distance defines retention indices and V re-uses the same positions, so retained tokens round-trip exactly while merged tokens preserve per-token magnitude via the shared direction. Same-layer pairs are rejected; the store exposes `has_pair`, `restore_pair`, `retention_indices`, `clear_pair`, and `clear`.
- H2O runtime caveat: the paper accumulates per-token attention sums across decode steps and retains heavy hitters plus a recent window. Runtime callers may pass an `attention_history` buffer (`[total_pages]` or `[kv_heads, total_pages]` per sequence); without it the policy falls back to a single-step Quest-style query-vs-page-extreme score (same fallback as Scissorhands). No sink, no random sampling, no probabilistic mode — H2O is always deterministic top-K-by-history + recent.
- SnapKV runtime caveat: identical scoring surface to H2O (optional `attention_history` per sequence, Quest-style fallback) but applies a 1D pool (`avgpool` with `count_include_pad=False`, or `maxpool`) of configurable `kernel_size` across the per-page score vector before top-K. This denoises neighbor pages: a single high-importance spike pulls its neighbors above isolated low-score pages, matching the paper's observation-window pooling intuition at the page granularity.
- Every method needs at least synthetic shape/budget tests in all target repos before GPU benchmarking.
